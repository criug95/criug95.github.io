I am a researcher focusing on the evolution of massive stars, both isolated and in binary systems, with particular interest in supernovae, black hole formation, and gravitational-wave astrophysics.

I have worked extensively on population synthesis using the SEVN code, supernova simulations with the HYPERION hydrocode, and studies of the 35 solar mass black hole mass distribution peak observed in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA data.
